## Purpose of this app
 This app is meant for players and DMs as a compendium for all things in Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Core.
 It uses an API to get all the info in the core game and give render it to the user in a clean and easy to 
 user interface. This project will be expanded on as I have free time.

## How to use
 From the landing page the user may select a category they wish to explore from the top bavigation bar.
 Once a category is selected the user will be navigated to a page where they may use a drop down menu
 to pull up a list of all relevent items such as monsters, spells, rules and equipment. Once the user
 selects an item the page will load with the appropiate information on the subject/item.
